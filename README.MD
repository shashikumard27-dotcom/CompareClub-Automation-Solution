# 🚀 MarTech Automation Architecture: Compare Club Solution

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a technical prototype designed for the **Compare Club** tech stack. It demonstrates how to bridge the gap between a **Data Warehouse (BigQuery/Snowflake)** and a **Marketing Cloud (Braze)** using Reverse ETL principles.

## 🛠️ Components
1. **SQL Logic:** A high-performance query designed to identify and clean high-value churn risks.
2. **Schema Mapping:** A JSON configuration defining the API sync between the warehouse and Braze.



## 🔗 Engineering Context & Deep Dive
While this folder provides a targeted solution, it is a subset of my larger work in **Modern Data Stack (MDS) orchestration**. 

For a comprehensive look at how I architected a full-scale **BigQuery-to-CRM pipeline**—including advanced error handling and multi-channel synchronization—please explore my flagship project here: https://github.com/shashikumard27-dotcom/serverless-marketing-pipeline/tree/main
